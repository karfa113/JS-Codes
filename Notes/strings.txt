# Creating strings: Strings can be created as primitives, from string literals, or as objects, using the String() constructor:

let string1 = "Hello, World!";
let string2 = new String("Hello, World!");

# Character Access: There are two ways to access an individual character in a string. 

The first is the charAt() method:
"cat".charAt(1); // gives value "a"

The other way is to treat the string as an array-like object, where individual characters correspond to a numerical index:

"cat"[1]; // also gives value "a"

# Comparing Strings: Strings can be compared using the comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, etc.). When comparing strings, the comparison is based on the Unicode values of the characters in the strings.
