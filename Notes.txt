constants: 
that cannot be changed throught the code
syntax:
const roll = 113

varibles:
that can be changed througout the code
syntax:
1. let name = "Monojit"
2. var name = "Monojit"
Prefer not to use var because of issue in block scope and functional scope.

Comments:
1. // Comments
2. /* Comments */

Print statement:
1. console.log()
2. console.table([abc, def, ghi])  - it will print all variables or constants and their value in table format.

# if you declare any variable and leave it without assigning any value js will assume it as undefined.
